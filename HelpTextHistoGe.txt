EXTENDED HELP OF histoGe
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MAIN OPTIONS

If no main option are provided then histoGe performs a query to 
database if extension of the file is .info, in other case, performs
a multiplot with the files provided,e.g.:

histoGe file1.extension [file2.extension ...]

The histoGe's main option are:

	-q|--query: Query the database to find isotopes that
		radiate gammas in the range from initial energy
		(iEner) to final energy (fEner) both in KeV, e.g.:
			histoGe -q 100 101

	-i|--isotope: Query the database to find gammas of each
		isotopes, e.g.:
			histoGe -i 60Co 241Am

	-p|--parent: Query the database looking for the parent 
		isotope and the child or children isotopes, e.g.:
			histoGe -p 60Co 241Am

	-r|--sub: Substraction of two sprectra, i.e., File2 is 
		substracted to File1.ext, e.g.:
			histoGe -r File1.ext File2.ext

	-s|--sum: Sumation of spectra. The option can sum all the
		spectra that the user need, e.g.:
			histoGe -s File1.ext File2.ext

	-t|--test: Performs a test. If histoGe was installed 
		successfully, then, test actions are executed
		without errors, e.g.:
			histoGe -t

	-P|--autoPeak: Look for peaks in a spectrum and generates
		a .info file which includes the ranges of the peaks
		found. It works better if the spectrum is rebinned,
		e.g.:
			histoGe --autoPeak File1.ext

	-R|--Rank|--rank: Performs a ranking for each peak contained
		in the .info file in order to find the most probable
		isotopes that explain the peaks observed in the
		spectrum, e.g:
			histoGe -R File1.info

	-e|--energyRanges: Look for all the isotopes that are in the
		ranges specified for each peak in the .info file,
		e.g.:
			histoGe -e File1.info

	-c|--stats: Calculate the Gilmore's statistics for each peak
		in the .info file, e.g.:
			histoGe -c File1.info File1.ext * 

*This option needs and .info file and the spectrum.

VALID FILES

Valid extensions are: .Txt, .SPA, .mca and .info

	.Txt files: Format file of gammavision software.

	.SPA files:  Format file developed and used in Boulby
