This is a simple program (still in alpha) for making spectra analysis
from germanium detectors. The name is still tentative and we'll
probably change the repo location.

The program accepts 3 different file formats, ("mca" the pocket
version, "Txt" gamma view format, "SPE" Boulby format.)

To install, simply do a:

$ mkdir -p ~/.myPrograms
$ cd ~/.myPrograms
$ ln -s /path/to/histoGe/histoGe.py histoGe # replace with proper path

Then open your shell rc file and put a line to export the new path, for
example if you are using bash then do a:

$ nano ~/.bashrc

Then put the following at the end of the file:

export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Save and close the file (in nano do a Ctr+X, you will be asked to save
the changes press Y for yes). Open a new terminal and you should be
able to do a:

$ histoGe
usage: histoGe file.extension [-c data4fits.info]
Valid extensions are:
		SPE
		mca
		Txt

You should be able to see a similar output.

I'll edit this document later to show a couple of examples. Remember
this is still alpha!!
